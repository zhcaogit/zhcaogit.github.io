Second Quantization, i.e., the quantum mechanics represented in the occupation number picture is the widely used technique in the Condensed Matter Theory. This part is crucial if you want to be engaged in this area in the future. The recommended introductory tutorial (Chapter 2 in the book Condensed Matter Field Theory by Altland Simons) for this part is listed below:

and I wish you would enjoy it.
